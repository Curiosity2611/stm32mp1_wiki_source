# About Me!

Hey there! My name is Deepak Reddy and I maintain this documentation. I hold an undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and I worked as a Hardware Design Engineer for 4 years in a startup. <br>

Recently I came accross the ST's line of Microprocessors and I felt it fascinating. I personally felt this is one of the best Microprocessor out there in the market as it is the combination of a MPU and MCU. This combination has many use cases and I felt I should try this out. So I bought STM32MP157C-DK2 development board and started experimenting. This documentation will be updated from time to time based on new learnings. This Wiki is designed to consolidate my knowledge into a one stop source for future refereces. That said, this Wiki is:

- Not exhaustive. 
- Constantly being updated with new information. 
- May contain some errors (will be corrected if found!)
