# Welcome to STM32MP1 Wiki

## Overview
This documentation is based on my personal learnings working with STM32MP157C-DK2 development board by STMicroelectronics. This documentation will be updated from time to time based on new learnings. This Wiki is designed to consolidate my knowledge into a one stop source for future refereces. That said, this Wiki is:

- Not exhaustive. 
- Constantly being updated with new information. 
- May contain some errors (will be corrected if found!)

## Introduction
The STM32MP157C-DK2 Discovery kits leverage the capabilities of STM32MP1 Series microprocessors to allow users easily develop applications using STM32 MPU OpenSTLinux Distribution software for the main processor and STM32CubeMP1 software for the co-processor. They include: 

- STM32MP157 Arm®-based dual Cortex®-A7 32 bits + Cortex®-M4 32 bits MPU in TFBGA361 package
- ST PMIC STPMIC1
- 4-Gbit DDR3L, 16 bits, 533 MHz
- 1-Gbps Ethernet (RGMII) compliant with IEEE-802.3ab
- USB OTG HS
- Audio codec
- 4 user LEDs
- 2 user and reset push-buttons, 1 wake-up button
- 5 V / 3 A USB Type-CTM power supply input
- Board connectors:Ethernet RJ454 × USB Host Type-AUSB Type-CTM DRPMIPI DSISMHDMI®Stereo headset jack including analog microphone inputmicroSDTM cardGPIO expansion connector (Raspberry Pi® shields capability)ARDUINO® Uno V3 expansion connectors
- On-board ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer with USB re-enumeration capability: Virtual COM port and debug port
- STM32CubeMP1 and full mainline open-source Linux® STM32 MPU OpenSTLinux Distribution (such as STM32MP1Starter) software and examples
- 4" TFT 480×800 pixels with LED backlight, MIPI DSISM interface, and capacitive touch panel 
- Wi-Fi® 802.11b/g/n
- Bluetooth Low Energy 4.1
